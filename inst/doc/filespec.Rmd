In this vignette, we discuss how to write file specifications and use them
to create a file collection. They help define the file packing scope in the
source R package.

```{r}
library("pkglite")
```

# File specification

In `pkglite`, a **file specification** defines the parameters to locate the
files matching specific criteria under an R package. One can use `file_spec()`
to create a file specification.

For example, to match the `.R` files under the `R/` folder, use

```{r}
fs <- file_spec(
  "R/",
  pattern = "\\.R$", format = "text",
  recursive = FALSE, ignore_case = TRUE, all_files = FALSE
)

fs
```

# File collection

A **file collection** is generated by evaluating file specification(s)
under a package directory. It contains the metadata of the list of
matching files. Use `collate()` to create a file collection:

```{r}
pkg <- system.file("examples/pkg1/", package = "pkglite")
```

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(fs)
```

# File specification templates

We have included a few file specifications to cover the common file
structures in an R package. See `?file_spec_templates` for details.
We will use some of them to demonstrate how to combine them to
cover an entire package.

# File specification usage patterns

To generate a file collection that includes a core set of files under the
package root, use

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(file_root_core())
```

To include all files under the package root, use

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(file_root_all())
```

Sometimes, a file collection might contain files or directories that should
always be excluded, such as the files defined in `pattern_file_sanitize()`.
One could use `sanitize_file_collection()` to remove such items from the
file collection:

```{r}
pkg %>%
  collate(file_root_all()) %>%
  sanitize_file_collection()
```

We can feed one or more file specifications to `collate()`.
The union of the matched files will be returned:

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(file_r(), file_man())
```

If file specification did not match any files, an empty file collection
is returned:

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(file_src())
```

Naturally, this would not add additional files to the collection:

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(file_r(), file_man(), file_src())
```

# Default file specification

`file_default()` offers a default combination of the file specification
templates.

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(file_default())
```

# Automatic file specification

`file_auto()` provides a specification that lists all files (with an extension)
under a folder recursively. It also guesses the file format type based on
the file extension. This is useful for directories like `inst/` that
do not share a standard structure or filename pattern across packages.

```{r}
pkg %>% collate(file_auto("inst/"))
```
