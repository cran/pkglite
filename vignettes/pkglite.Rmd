## Introduction

`pkglite` offers a solution for converting R package source code to a compact,
text-based representation and restore the source package structure from
the representation. There are three specific aims:

1. To provide a **tool** for packing and restoring R packages as plain text
assets that are easy to store, transfer, and review.
1. To provide a **grammar** for specifying the file packing scope that is
functional, precise, and extendable.
1. To provide a **standard** for exchanging the packed asset that is
unambiguous, human-friendly, and machine-readable.

To achieve these goals, we developed a pipe-friendly workflow, the concept of
file specifications and file collections, and a format specification for
the output file `pkglite.txt`. These designs allow us to leave a clear and
skimmable trace in the code when generating such compact representations,
thus improves reproducibility.

## Example workflow

To demonstrate the basic usage of pkglite, we will show how to pack and unpack
one or multiple R packages.

```{r}
library("pkglite")
```

### Pack one package

First, locate the input package directory and the output file:

```{r}
pkg <- system.file("examples/pkg1", package = "pkglite")
txt <- tempfile(fileext = ".txt")
```

Use the following chain of calls to pack a default set of files in
the R package under directory `pkg` into the file `txt`:

```{r}
pkg %>%
  collate(file_default()) %>%
  pack(output = txt, quiet = TRUE)
```

The `collate()` function evaluates one or more **file specifications**
to generate a **file collection**. They fully determine the scope of the files
to pack here. For details, check `vignette("filespec", package = "pkglite")`.

Check the first lines of the output file:

```{r}
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  head(11) %>%
  cat(sep = "\n")
```

Check the number of lines the output file:

```{r}
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  length()
```

### Unpack one package

To unpack (restore) the file structures from the text file, use `unpack()`:

```{r}
out <- file.path(tempdir(), "onepkg")
txt %>% unpack(output = out, quiet = TRUE)
```

This will create a directory named after the R package under the output directory:

```{r}
out %>%
  file.path("pkg1") %>%
  list.files()
```

To install the packages after unpacking them, use `unpack(..., install = TRUE)`.

### Pack multiple packages

`pack()` accepts one or more input directories. Therefore, one can pack
multiple R packages (file collections) into one file at once:

```{r}
pkg1 <- system.file("examples/pkg1", package = "pkglite")
pkg2 <- system.file("examples/pkg2", package = "pkglite")

fc1 <- pkg1 %>% collate(file_default())
fc2 <- pkg2 %>% collate(file_default())

pack(fc1, fc2, output = txt, quiet = TRUE)
```

Since the two example packages have almost identical content,
the number of lines in the text file is doubled here
(three header lines excluded):

```{r}
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  length()
```

### Unpack multiple packages

Use the same call to unpack (and install) multiple R packages from the text file:

```{r}
out <- file.path(tempdir(), "twopkgs")
txt %>% unpack(output = out, quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r}
out %>%
  file.path("pkg1") %>%
  list.files()
out %>%
  file.path("pkg2") %>%
  list.files()
```

The file format specification for `pkglite.txt` is described in
`vignette("format", package = "pkglite")`.

## Helper functions

Verify if the text file contains only ASCII characters:

```{r}
txt %>% verify_ascii()
```

Remove lines of file content from the text file:

```{r}
txt %>% remove_content(c("## New Features", "## Improvements"), quiet = TRUE)
```

```{r}
txt %>%
  readLines() %>%
  length()
```
