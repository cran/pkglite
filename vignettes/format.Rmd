The output file of `pkglite::pack()` uses a standard file format to allow the
storage, exchange, and parsing of the packaged assets. The specification
for this file is detailed below.

## Filename and extension

Unless specified, the output file is automatically named.

- A single R package named `pkg1` is packed into `pkg1.txt`.
- Multiple R packages named `pkg1`, `pkg2`, ... are packed into `pkglite.txt`.

The file extension is `.txt` so that one can recognize, open, and inspect
it directly using regular text editors.

## File format

The overall goal here is to make the file format unambiguous, human-friendly,
and machine-readable. For `pkglite.txt`, we follow the
[DCF (Debian Control File) format](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html),
used by Debian, R, and RStudio IDE.
The minimalist, time-tested format allows us to save key-value data in
plain text that humans can easily read and write.
The format is also extendable to include more information
about the assets being packed.

## File structure

A `pkglite.txt` is structured following these rules:

- One file contains multiple DCF format blocks.
- Each block includes the metadata and the content of one file in an R package.
- Each block is separated by a blank line. The last block has a trailing blank line.

## Field names and values

Each block has at least four key-value pairs called **fields**. For example:

```
Package: pkglite
File: R/pkglite-package.R
Format: text
Content:
  #' @keywords internal
  "_PACKAGE"
```

The keys and values in these fields are separated by a colon and a whitespace
except for `Content`, whose value part starts in a new line.

### `Package`

R package name. Since one `pkglite.txt` might contain files from multiple packages,
this field is used to declare the package the file is under explicitly.

This design implies that each `pkglite.txt` can only store multiple
R packages with unique names.

### `File`

The relative path (to the package root) of the file.

### `Format`

File format category. It can be `text` or `binary`. This determines how the file
content will be read and written.

### `Content`

The file content. The text format files are stored as-is, while the binary files
are stored in the hexadecimal format, following the RTF format convention.
In both cases, two whitespaces are added before each line of the value part.
